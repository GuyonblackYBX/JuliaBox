### Packages installed

Following packages are installed by default. Additional packages can be installed and existing packages can be upgraded by users as desired. 

However, user installed packages may not be retained across sessions. Also since the JuliaBox user is not a priviledged user, packages requiring additional system packages may not install correctly. There will be an alternate mechanism for installing additional packages in the future.
