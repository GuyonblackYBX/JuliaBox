These scripts are useful while developing on a local machine. The primary difference is in the setup script that does not enforce any particular configuration for installing the dependencies. Nginx openresty is compiled and installed in a separate local folder for this project.

These scripts should be run from the `JDock` folder as usual by invoking them as `dev/*.sh`.
